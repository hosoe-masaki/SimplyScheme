##### 14.14 Write a predicate same-shape? that takes two sentences as arguments. It should return #t if two conditions are met: The two sentences must have the same number of words, and each word of the first sentence must have the same number of letters as the word in the corresponding position in the second sentence.
```Scheme
> (same-shape? '(the fool on the hill) '(you like me too much))
#T

> (same-shape? '(the fool on the hill) '(and your bird can sing))
#F
```

Answer

```Scheme
(define (same-shape? s1 s2)
  (cond ((and (empty? s1) (empty? s2)) #t)
        ((empty? s1) #f)
        ((empty? s2) #f)
        ((not (equal? (count (first s1)) (count (first s2)))) #f)
        (else (same-shape? (bf s1) (bf s2)))))
```
