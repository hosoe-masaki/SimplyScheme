##### 14.11 Write the procedure remove-adjacent-duplicates that takes a sentence as argument and returns the same sentence but with any word that's immediately followed by the same word removed:
```Scheme
> (remove-adjacent-duplicates '(y a b b a d a b b a d o o))
(Y A B A D A B A D O)

> (remove-adjacent-duplicates '(yeah yeah yeah))
(YEAH)
```

Answer

```Scheme
(define (remove-adjacent-duplicates sent)
  (cond ((equal? (count sent) 1) sent)
        ((equal? (first sent) (first (bf sent))) (remove-adjacent-duplicates (bf sent)))
        (else (se (first sent) (remove-adjacent-duplicates (bf sent))))))
```
