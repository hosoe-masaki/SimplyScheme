```Scheme
> (remove-once 'morning '(good morning good morning))
(GOOD GOOD MORNING)
```
(It's okay if your solution removes the other MORNING instead, as long as it removes only one of them.)

```Scheme
(define (remove-once w s)
  (cond ((empty? s) '())
        ((equal? w (first s)) (bf s))
        (else (se (first s) (remove-once w (bf s))))))
```
