##### 19.7 Write a procedure true-for-all-pairs? that takes a predicate and a sentence as arguments. The predicate must accept two words as its arguments. Your procedure should return #t if the argument predicate will return true for *every* two adjacent words in the sentence:
```Scheme
> (true-for-all-pairs? equal? '(a b c c d))
#F

> (true-for-all-pairs? equal? '(a a a a a))
#T

> (true-for-all-pairs? < '(20 16 5 8 6))
#F

> (true-for-all-pairs? < '(3 7 19 22 43))
#T
```

Answer

```Scheme
(define (true-for-all-pairs? pred sent)
  (cond ((= (count sent) 1) #t)
        ((not (pred (first sent) (first (bf sent)))) #f)
        (else (true-for-all-pairs? pred (bf sent)))))
```
