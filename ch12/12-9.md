##### 12.9 Write a procedure real-words that takes a sentence as argument and returns all the "real" words of the sentence, using the same rule as the real-word? procedure from Chapter 1.

```Scheme
(define (real-word? wd)
  (not (member? wd '(a the an if of and for to with))))

(define (real-words sent)
  (if (empty? sent)
      '()
      (if (real-word? (first sent))
          (se (first sent) (real-words (bf sent)))
          (real-words (bf sent)))))
```
