Now write a procedure two-first-sent that takes a two-word sentence as argument, returning a two-letter word containing the first letters of the two words.
```Scheme
> (two-first-sent '(brian epstein))
BE
```

```Scheme
(define (two-first w1 w2)
  (word (first w1) (first w2)))

;(define (two-first-sent s)
;  (word (first (first s)) (first (last s))))

(define (two-first-sent s)
  (two-first (first s) (last s)))
```
