##### 15.6 Let's say a gladiator kills a roach. If we want to talk about the roach, we say "the roach the gladiator killed." But if we want to talk about the gladiator, we say "the gladiator that killed the roach."
People are pretty good at understanding even rather long sentences as long as they're straightforward: "This is the farmer who kept the cock that waked the priest that married the man that kissed the maiden that milked the cow that tossed the dog that worried the cat that killed the rat that ate the malt that lay in the house that Jack built." But even a short nested sentence is confusing: "This is the rat the cat the dog worried killed." Which rat was that?
Write a procedure unscramble that takes a nested sentence as argument and returns a straightforward sentence about the same cast of characters:
```Scheme
> (unscramble '(this is the roach the gladiator killed))
(THIS IS THE GLADIATOR THAT KILLED THE ROACH)
> (unscramble '(this is the rat the cat the dog the boy the girl saw owned chased bit))
(THIS IS THE GIRL THAT SAW THE BOY THAT OWNED THE DOG THAT CHASED THE CAT THAT BIT THE RAT)
```
You may assume that the argument has exactly the structure of these examples, with no special cases like "that lay in the house" or "that Jack built."
