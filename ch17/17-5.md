##### 17.5 Here's a procedure that takes two numbers as arguments and returns whichever number is larger:
```Scheme
(define (max2 a b)
  (if (> b a) b a))
```

Use max2 to implement max, a procedure that takes one or more numeric arguments and returns the largest of them.

```Scheme
(define (max a . b)
  (if (null? b)
      a
      (apply max (append (list (max2 a (car b))) (cdr b)))))
```
