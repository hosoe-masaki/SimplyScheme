##### 6.7  Write a procedure type-of that takes anything as its argument and returns one of the words word, sentence, number, or boolean:
```Scheme
> (type-of '(getting better))
SENTENCE

> (type-of 'revolution)
WORD

> (type-of (= 3 3))
BOOLEAN
```

(Even though numbers are words, your procedure should return number if its argument is a number.)

Feel free to check for more specific types, such as "positive integer," if you are so inclined.

```Scheme
(define (type-of arg)
  (cond ((number?  arg) 'NUMBER)
        ((word? arg) 'WORD)
        ((sentence? arg) 'SENTENCE)
        ((boolean? arg) 'BOOLEAN)))
```
