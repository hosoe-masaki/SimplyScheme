##### 9.15  Many functions are applicable only to arguments in a certain domain and result in error messages if given arguments outside that domain. For example, sqrt may require a nonnegative argument in a version of Scheme that doesn't include complex numbers. (In any version of Scheme, sqrt will complain if its argument isn't a number at all!) Once a program gets an error message, it's impossible for that program to continue the computation.

Write a procedure type-check that takes as arguments a one-argument procedure f and a one-argument predicate procedure pred. Type-check should return a one-argument procedure that first applies pred to its argument; if that result is true, the procedure should return the value computed by applying f to the argument; if pred returns false, the new procedure should also return #f:

> (safe-sqrt 16)

> (safe-sqrt 'sarsaparilla)
#F
```

Answer

```Scheme
(define (type-check f pred)
  (lambda (arg) (if (pred arg) (f arg) #f)))
```
