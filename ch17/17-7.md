##### 17.7 Append may remind you of sentence. They're similar, except that append works only with lists as arguments, whereas sentence will accept words as well as lists. Implement sentence using append. (Note: The built-in sentence can take any number of arguments. First write a version that accepts only two arguments. Then, optionally, try to write a version that takes any number. Also, you don't have to worry about the error checking that the real sentence does.)

```Scheme
(define (my-sentence w1 . w2)
  (cond ((null? w2) (if (list? w1) w1 (list w1)))
        ((list? w1) (append (append w1) (apply my-sentence (car w2) (cdr w2))))
        (else (append (list w1) (apply my-sentence (car w2) (cdr w2))))))
```
