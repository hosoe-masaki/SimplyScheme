##### 19.2 Write keep. Don't forget that keep has to return a sentence if its second argument is a sentence, and a word if its second argument is a word.
(Hint: it might be useful to write a combine procedure that uses either word or sentence depending on the types of its arguments.)

```Scheme
(define (my-keep f structure)
  (cond ((word? structure) (keep-word f structure))
        (else (keep-sentence f structure))))

(define (keep-word f structure)
  (cond ((empty? structure) "")
        (else (if (f (first structure))
                  (word (first structure) (keep-word f (bf structure)))
                  (keep-word f (bf structure))))))

(define (keep-sentence f structure)
  (cond ((empty? structure) '())
        (else (if (f (first structure))
                  (se (first structure) (keep-sentence f (bf structure)))
                  (keep-sentence f (bf structure))))))
```
