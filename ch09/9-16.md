##### 9.16  In the language APL, most arithmetic functions can be applied either to a number, with the usual result, or to a vector—the APL name for a sentence of numbers—in which case the result is a new vector in which each element is the result of applying the function to the corresponding element of the argument. For example, the function sqrt applied to 16 returns 4 as in Scheme, but sqrt can also be applied to a sentence such as (16 49) and it returns (4 7).

Write a procedure aplize that takes as its argument a one-argument procedure whose domain is numbers or words. It should return an APLized procedure that also accepts sentences:
```Scheme
> (define apl-sqrt (aplize sqrt))

> (apl-sqrt 36)
6

> (apl-sqrt '(1 100 25 16))
(1 10 5 4)
```

Answer

```Scheme
(define (aplize f)
  (lambda (arg)
    (cond ((sentence? arg) (every f arg))
          (else (f arg)))))
```
