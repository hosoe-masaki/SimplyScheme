##### 14.7 Write differences, which takes a sentence of numbers as its argument and returns a sentence containing the differences between adjacent elements. (The length of the returned sentence is one less than that of the argument.)
```Scheme
> (differences '(4 23 9 87 6 12))
(19 -14 78 -81 6)
```

Answer

```Scheme
(define (differences sent)
  (if (equal? (count sent) 1)
      '()
      (se (- (first (bf sent)) (first sent)) (differences (bf sent)))))
```
