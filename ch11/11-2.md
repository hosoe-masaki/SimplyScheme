##### 11.2 When you teach a class, people will get distracted if you say "um" too many times. Write a count-ums that counts the number of times "um" appears in a sentence:

```Scheme
> (count-ums '(today um we are going to um talk about the combining um method))
3
```

Here are some special-case count-ums procedures for sentences of particular lengths:

```Scheme
(define (count-ums0 sent)
  0)

(define (count-ums1 sent)
  (if (equal? 'um (first sent))
      1
      0))

(define (count-ums2 sent)
  (if (equal? 'um (first sent))
      (+ 1 (count-ums1 (bf sent)))
      (count-ums1 (bf sent))))

(define (count-ums3 sent)
  (if (equal? 'um (first sent))
      (+ 1 (count-ums2 (bf sent)))
      (count-ums2 (bf sent))))
```

Write count-ums recursively.

```Scheme
(define (count-ums sent)
  (if (empty? sent)
      0
      (if (equal? 'um (first sent))
          (+ 1 (count-ums (bf sent)))
          (count-ums (bf sent)))))

(define (count-ums sent)
  (cond ((empty? sent) 0)
        ((equal? 'um (first sent)) (+ 1 (count-ums (bf sent))))
        (else (count-ums (bf sent)))))
```
