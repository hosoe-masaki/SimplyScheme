##### 4.6  Define a procedure fourth that computes the fourth power of its argument. Do this two ways, first using the multiplication function, and then using square and not (directly) using multiplication.

```Scheme
(define (square x)
  (* x x))

(define (fourth1 x)
  (* x x x x))

(define (fourth2 x)
  (square (square x)))
```
