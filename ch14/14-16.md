##### 14.16 Write a procedure syllables that takes a word as its argument and returns the number of syllables in the word, counted according to the following rule: the number of syllables is the number of vowels, except that a group of consecutive vowels counts as one. For example, in the word "soaring," the group "oa" represents one syllable and the vowel "i" represents a second one.

Be sure to choose test cases that expose likely failures of your procedure. For example, what if the word ends with a vowel? What if it ends with two vowels in a row? What if it has more than two consecutive vowels?

(Of course this rule isn't good enough. It doesn't deal with things like silent "e"s that don't create a syllable ("like"), consecutive vowels that don't form a diphthong ("cooperate"), letters like "y" that are vowels only sometimes, etc. If you get bored, see whether you can teach the program to recognize some of these special cases.)
