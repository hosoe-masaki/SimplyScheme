##### 6.10  Write a procedure sort2 that takes as its argument a sentence containing two numbers. It should return a sentence containing the same two numbers, but in ascending order:
```Scheme
> (sort2 '(5 7))
(5 7)

> (sort2 '(7 5))
(5 7)
```

```Scheme
(define (sort2 se)
  (if (< (first se) (last se)) se (sentence (last se) (first se))))
```
