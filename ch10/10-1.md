##### 10.1  The ttt procedure assumes that nobody has won the game yet. What happens if you invoke ttt with a board position in which some player has already won? Try to figure it out by looking through the program before you run it.

勝敗が決しても、ゲームは続けられる。どちらが勝ったかの判断ができない

A complete tic-tac-toe program would need to stop when one of the two players wins. Write a predicate already-won? that takes a board position and a letter (x or o) as its arguments and returns #t if that player has already won.

```Scheme
(define (already-won? position me)
  (not (empty? (keep (lambda (triple) (my-triple? triple me)) (find-triples position)))))

(define (my-triple? triple me)
  (= (appearances me triple) 3))

; (already-won? 'xox_x_xoo 'x) ; #t
; (already-won? 'xox_x_xoo 'o) ; #f

; find-triples して三つとも me な triple があれば #t
```
