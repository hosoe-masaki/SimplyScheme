##### 17.2 For each of the following examples, write a procedure of two arguments that, when applied to the sample arguments, returns the sample result. Your procedures may not include any quoted data.
```Scheme
> (f1 '(a b c) '(d e f))
((B C D))

> (f2 '(a b c) '(d e f))
((B C) E)

> (f3 '(a b c) '(d e f))
(A B C A B C)

> (f4 '(a b c) '(d e f))
((A D) (B C E F))
```

Answer

```Scheme
(define (f1 lst1 lst2)
  (list (append (cdr lst1) (list (car lst2)))))

(define (f2 lst1 lst2)
  (list (cdr lst1) (cadr lst2)))

(define (f3 lst1 lst2)
  (append lst1 lst1))

(define (f4 lst1 lst2)
  (list (list (car lst1) (car lst2)) (append (cdr lst1) (cdr lst2))))
```
