##### 12.4 Here's the definition of a function f:
if *sent* is empty f(*sent*) = sent otherwise f(*sent*) = sentence(f(butfirst(*sent*)),first(sent))

Implement f as a Scheme procedure. What does f do?

```Scheme
(define (f sent)
  (if (empty? sent)
      sent
      (se (f (butfirst sent)) (first sent))))
```
