##### 18.6 Write a program parse-scheme that parses a Scheme arithmetic expression into the same kind of tree that parse produces for infix expressions. Assume that all procedure invocations in the Scheme expression have two arguments.
The resulting tree should be a valid argument to compute:
```Scheme
> (compute (parse-scheme '(* (+ 4 3) 2)))
14
```
(You can solve this problem without the restriction to two-argument invocations if you rewrite compute so that it doesn't assume every branch node has two children.)
