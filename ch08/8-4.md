##### 8.4  Write a procedure choose-beatles that takes a predicate function as its argument and returns a sentence of just those Beatles (John, Paul, George, and Ringo) that satisfy the predicate. For example:
```Scheme
(define (ends-vowel? wd) (vowel? (last wd)))

(define (even-count? wd) (even? (count wd)))

> (choose-beatles ends-vowel?)
(GEORGE RINGO)

> (choose-beatles even-count?)
(JOHN PAUL GEORGE)
```

Answer

```Scheme
(define (choose-beatles pred)
  (keep pred '(John Paul George Ringo)))
```
