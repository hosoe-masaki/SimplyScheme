##### 17.13 Here is a procedure that counts the number of words anywhere within a structured list:
```Scheme
(define (deep-count lst)
  (cond ((null? lst) 0)
        ((word? (car lst)) (+ 1 (deep-count (cdr lst))))
        (else (+ (deep-count (car lst))
                 (deep-count (cdr lst))))))
```

Although this procedure works, it's more complicated than necessary. Simplify it.

```Scheme
(define (deep-count lst)
  (length (flatten lst)))
```
