##### 19.6 Write a procedure true-for-any-pair? that takes a predicate and a sentence as arguments. The predicate must accept two words as its arguments. Your procedure should return #t if the argument predicate will return true for any two adjacent words in the sentence:
```Scheme
> (true-for-any-pair? equal? '(a b c b a))
#F

> (true-for-any-pair? equal? '(a b c c d))
#T

> (true-for-any-pair? < '(20 16 5 8 6))
#T
```

Answer

```Scheme
(define (true-for-any-pair? pred sent)
  (cond ((= (count sent) 1) #f)
        ((pred (first sent) (first (bf sent))) #t)
        (else (true-for-any-pair? pred (bf sent)))))
```
