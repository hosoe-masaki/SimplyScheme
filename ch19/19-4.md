##### 19.4 Our accumulate combines elements from right to left. That is,
```Scheme
(accumulate - '(2 3 4 5))
```
computes 2 - (3 - (4 - 5)). Write left-accumulate, which will compute ((2 - 3) - 4) - 5 instead. (The result will be the same for an operation such as +, for which grouping order doesn¡Çt matter, but will be different for -.)

```Scheme
(define (left-accumulate f sent)
  (if (= (count sent) 1)
      (first sent)
      (f (left-accumulate f (bl sent)) (last sent))))
```
