##### 13.4 Here is a Scheme procedure that never finishes its job:
```Scheme
(define (forever n)
  (if (= n 0)
      1
      (+ 1 (forever n))))
```

Explain why it doesn't give any result. (If you try to trace it, make sure you know how to make your version of Scheme stop what it's doing and give you another prompt.)

* n が 0 以外の時に再帰するが、引数が n で変わらないため base case の 0 には絶対にならないため
