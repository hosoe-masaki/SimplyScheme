##### 14.8 Write expand, which takes a sentence as its argument. It returns a sentence similar to the argument, except that if a number appears in the argument, then the return value contains that many copies of the following word:
```Scheme
> (expand '(4 calling birds 3 french hens))
(CALLING CALLING CALLING CALLING BIRDS FRENCH FRENCH FRENCH HENS)

> (expand '(the 7 samurai))
(THE SAMURAI SAMURAI SAMURAI SAMURAI SAMURAI SAMURAI SAMURAI)
```

Answer

```Scheme
(define (expand sent)
  (cond ((equal? (count sent) 1) sent)
        ((equal? (first sent) 1) (se (expand (bf sent))))
        ((number? (first sent)) (expand (se (- (first sent) 1) (first (bf sent)) (bf sent))))
        (else (se (first sent) (expand (bf sent))))))
```
