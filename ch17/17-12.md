##### 17.12 Write a procedure called flatten that takes as its argument a list, possibly including sublists, but whose ultimate building blocks are words (not Booleans or procedures). It should return a sentence containing all the words of the list, in the order in which they appear in the original:
```Scheme
> (flatten '(((a b) c (d e)) (f g) ((((h))) (i j) k)))
(A B C D E F G H I J K)
```

Answer

```Scheme
(define (flatten lst)
  (cond ((null? lst) '())
        ((list? (car lst)) (append (flatten (car lst)) (flatten (cdr lst))))
        ((equal? (length lst) 1) (append lst (flatten (cdr lst))))
        (else (cons (car lst) (flatten (cdr lst))))))
```
