##### 14.13 What does the pigl procedure from Chapter 11 do if you invoke it with a word like "frzzmlpt" that has no vowels? Fix it so that it returns "frzzmlptay."
```Scheme
(define (pigl wd)
  (pigl-helper wd wd))
(define (pigl-helper orig-wd wd)
  (if (member? (first wd) 'aeiou)
      (word wd 'ay)
      (if (equal? orig-wd (word (bf wd) (first wd)))
          (word orig-wd 'ay)
          (pigl-helper orig-wd (word (bf wd) (first wd))))))
```
