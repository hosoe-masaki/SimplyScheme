#### Real Exercises

##### 6.5  Write a procedure european-time to convert a time from American AM/PM notation into European 24-hour notation. Also write american-time, which does the opposite:
```Scheme
> (european-time '(8 am))
8

> (european-time '(4 pm))
16

> (american-time 21)
(9 PM)

> (american-time 12)
(12 PM)

> (european-time '(12 am))
24
```
Getting noon and midnight right is tricky.

```Scheme
(define (european-time time-se)
  (if (or (equal? time-se '(12 am)) (equal? (last time-se) 'pm)) (+ 12 (first time-se)) (first time-se)))

(define (american-time time-se)
  (se (if (and (>= time-se 13) (<= time-se 24)) (- time-se 12) time-se) (if (and (>= time-se 12) (<= time-se 23)) 'pm 'am)))
```
