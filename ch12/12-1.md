#### Boring Exercises

##### 12.1 Here is a definition of a procedure that returns the sum of the numbers in its argument sentence:
```Scheme
(define (addup nums)
  (if (empty? (bf nums))
      (first nums)
      (+ (first nums) (addup (bf nums)))))
```

Although this works, it could be simplified by changing the base case. Do that.

```Scheme
(define (addup nums)
  (if (empty? nums)
      0
      (+ (first nums) (addup (bf nums)))))
```
