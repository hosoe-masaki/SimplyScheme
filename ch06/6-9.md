##### 6.9  Sometimes you must choose the singular or the plural of a word: 1 book but 2 books. Write a procedure thismany that takes two arguments, a number and a singular noun, and combines them appropriately:
```Scheme
> (thismany 1 'partridge)
(1 PARTRIDGE)

> (thismany 3 'french-hen)
(3 FRENCH-HENS)
```

```Scheme
(define (thismany num noun)
  (se num (if (> num 1) (word noun 's) noun)))
```
