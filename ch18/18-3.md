##### 18.3 Write depth, a procedure that takes a tree as argument and returns the largest number of nodes connected through parent-child links. That is, a leaf node has depth 1; a tree in which all the children of the root node are leaves has depth 2. Our world tree has depth 4 (because the longest path from the root to a leaf is, for example, world, country, state, city).

```Scheme
(define (depth tree)
  (if (leaf? tree)
      1
      (+ 1 (depth-in-forest (children tree)))))

(define (depth-in-forest forest)
  (if (null? forest)
      0
      (max (depth (car forest))
           (depth-in-forest (cdr forest)))))
```
