##### 14.15 Write merge, a procedure that takes two sentences of numbers as arguments. Each sentence must consist of numbers in increasing order. Merge should return a single sentence containing all of the numbers, in order. (We'll use this in the next chapter as part of a sorting algorithm.)
```Scheme
> (merge '(4 7 18 40 99) '(3 6 9 12 24 36 50))
(3 4 6 7 9 12 18 24 36 40 50 99)
```

Answer

```Scheme
(define (merge s1 s2)
  (merge-helper s1 s2 '()))

(define (merge-helper s1 s2 sorted)
  (cond ((empty? s1) (se sorted s2))
        ((empty? s2) (se sorted s1))
        ((> (first s1) (first s2)) (merge-helper s1 (bf s2) (se sorted (first s2))))
        (else (merge-helper (bf s1) s2 (se sorted (first s1))))))
```
