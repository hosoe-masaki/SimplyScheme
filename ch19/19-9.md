##### 19.9 Rewrite either of the sort procedures from Chapter 15 to take two arguments, a list and a predicate. It should sort the elements of that list according to the given predicate:
```Scheme
> (my-sort '(4 23 7 5 16 3) <)
(3 4 5 7 16 23)

> (my-sort '(4 23 7 5 16 3) >)
(23 16 7 5 4 3)

> (my-sort '(john paul george ringo) before?)
(GEORGE JOHN PAUL RINGO)
```

Answer

```Scheme
(define (my-sort sent pred)
  (if (empty? sent)
      '()
      (se (earliest-word sent pred)
          (my-sort (remove-once (earliest-word sent pred) sent) pred))))

(define (earliest-word sent pred)
  (earliest-helper (first sent) (bf sent) pred))

(define (earliest-helper so-far rest pred)
  (cond ((empty? rest) so-far)
        ((pred so-far (first rest))
         (earliest-helper so-far (bf rest) pred))
        (else (earliest-helper (first rest) (bf rest) pred))))

(define (remove-once wd sent)
  (cond ((empty? sent) '())
        ((equal? wd (first sent)) (bf sent))
        (else (se (first sent) (remove-once wd (bf sent))))))
```
