= The following exercises ask for functions that meet certain criteria. For your convenience, here are the functions in this chapter: +, -, /, <=, <, =, >=, >, and, appearances, butfirst, butlast, cos, count, equal?, every, even?, expt, first, if, item, keep, last, max, member?, not, number?, number-of-arguments, odd?, or, quotient, random, remainder, round, sentence, sqrt, vowel?, and word.

== 2.5   List the one-argument functions in this chapter for which the type of the return value is always different from the type of the argument.
even?, number?, number-of-arguments, odd?, vowel?

== 2.6   List the one-argument functions in this chapter for which the type of the return value is sometimes different from the type of the argument.
count, first, last

== 2.7   Mathematicians sometimes use the term "operator" to mean a function of two arguments, both of the same type, that returns a result of the same type. Which of the functions you've seen in this chapter satisfy that definition?
+, -, /, and, max, or, quotient, remainder

== 2.8  An operator f is commutative if f(a,b)=f(b,a) for all possible arguments A and B. For example, + is commutative, but word isn't. Which of the operators from Exercise 2.7 are commutative?
+, and, max, or

== 2.9  An operator f is associative if f(f(a,b),c)=f(a,f(f(b,c)) for all possible arguments A, B, and C. For example, * is associative, but not /. Which of the operators from Exercise 2.7 are associative?
+, -, and, max, or
