##### 15.5 Suppose you have a phone number, such as 223-5766, and you'd like to figure out a clever way to spell it in letters for your friends to remember. Each digit corresponds to three possible letters. For example, the digit 2 corresponds to the letters A, B, and C. Write a procedure that takes a number as argument and returns a sentence of all the possible spellings:

```Scheme
> (phone-spell 2235766)
(AADJPMM AADJPMN ... CCFLSOO)
```

(We're not showing you all 2187 words in this sentence.) You may assume there are no zeros or ones in the number, since those don't have letters.
Hint: This problem has a lot in common with the subsets example.
