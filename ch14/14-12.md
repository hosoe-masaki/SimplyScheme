##### 14.12 Write a procedure progressive-squares? that takes a sentence of numbers as its argument. It should return #t if each number (other than the first) is the square of the number before it:
```Scheme
> (progressive-squares? '(3 9 81 6561))
#T

> (progressive-squares? '(25 36 49 64))
#F
```

Answer

```Scheme
(define (progressive-squares? s)
  (if (equal? (count s) 1)
      #f
      (progressive-squares?-helper s)))
(define (progressive-squares?-helper s)
  (cond ((equal? (count s) 1) #t)
        ((not (equal? (* (first s) (first s)) (first (bf s)))) #f)
        (else (progressive-squares?-helper (bf s)))))
```
