##### 8.12 When you teach a class, people will get distracted if you say "um" too many times. Write a count-ums that counts the number of times "um" appears in a sentence:
```Scheme
> (count-ums '(today um we are going to um talk about functional um programming))
3
```

Answer

```Scheme
(define (check-um w)
  (equal? w 'um))

(define (count-ums sent)
  (count (keep check-um sent)))
