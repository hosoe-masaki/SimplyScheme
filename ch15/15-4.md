##### 15.4 Write a predicate procedure substring? that takes two words as arguments and returns #t if and only if the first word is a substring of the second. (See Exercise 15.3 for the definition of a substring.)

Be careful about cases in which you encounter a "false start," like this:
```Scheme
> (substring? 'ssip 'mississippi)
#T
```

and also about subsets that don't appear as consecutive letters in the second word:

```Scheme
> (substring? 'misip 'mississippi)
#F
```

```Scheme
(define (substring? wd1 wd2)
  (member? wd1 (substrings wd2)))
```
