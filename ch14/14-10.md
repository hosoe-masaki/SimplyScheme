##### 14.10 Write the procedure count-adjacent-duplicates that takes a sentence as an argument and returns the number of words in the sentence that are immediately followed by the same word:
```Scheme
> (count-adjacent-duplicates '(y a b b a d a b b a d o o))
3

> (count-adjacent-duplicates '(yeah yeah yeah))
2
```

Answer

```Scheme
(define (count-adjacent-duplicates sent)
  (count-adjacent-duplicates-helper 0 sent))
(define (count-adjacent-duplicates-helper num sent)
  (cond ((equal? (count sent) 1) num)
        ((equal? (first sent) (first (bf sent))) (count-adjacent-duplicates-helper (+ num 1) (bf sent)))
        (else (count-adjacent-duplicates-helper num (bf sent)))))
```
