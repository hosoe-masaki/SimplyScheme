##### 12.2 Fix the bug in the following definition:
```Scheme
(define (acronym sent)                       ;; wrong
  (if (= (count sent) 1)
      (first sent)
      (word (first (first sent))
	    (acronym (bf sent)))))
```

Answer

```Scheme
(define (acronym sent)
  (if (= (count sent) 1)
      (first sent)
      (if (empty? (first sent))
          (acronym (bf sent))
          (word (first (first sent)) (acronym (bf sent))))))
```
