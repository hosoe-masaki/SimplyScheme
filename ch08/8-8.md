##### 8.8 Write an exaggerate procedure which exaggerates sentences:
```Scheme
> (exaggerate '(i ate 3 potstickers))
(I ATE 6 POTSTICKERS)

> (exaggerate '(the chow fun is good here))
(THE CHOW FUN IS GREAT HERE)
```

It should double all the numbers in the sentence, and it should replace "good" with "great," "bad" with "terrible," and anything else you can think of.

```Scheme
(define (exaggerate-word w)
  (cond ((number? w) (* 2 w))
        ((equal? w 'good) 'great)
        ((equal? w 'bad) 'terrible)
        (else w)
        ))
(define (exaggerate sent)
  (every exaggerate-word sent))
```
