##### 9.10  In Chapter 2 we used a function called appearances that returns the number of times its first argument appears as a member of its second argument. Implement appearances.
```Scheme
(define (appearances a b)
  (count (keep (lambda (w) (equal? a w)) b)))
```

```Scheme
(appearances 'a 'abcdefga)
(appearances 'a '(this is a pen))
(appearances 'a '(this is an apple))
```
