##### 3.2  How many little people does Alonzo hire in evaluating each of the following expressions:
For example,

```Scheme
(* (- 1 (+ 3 4)) 8)
```
has three subexpressions; you wouldn't count
```Scheme
(+ 3 4).
```

```Scheme
(+ 3 (* 4 5) (- 10 4))
```

3

```Scheme
(+ (* (- (/ 8 2) 1) 5) 2)
```
4

```Scheme
(* (+ (- 3 (/ 4 2))
      (sin (* 3 2))
      (- 8 (sqrt 5)))
   (- (/2 3)
      4))
```
