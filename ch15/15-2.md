##### 15.2 A "palindrome" is a sentence that reads the same backward as forward. Write a predicate palindrome? that takes a sentence as argument and decides whether it is a palindrome. For example:
```Scheme
> (palindrome? '(flee to me remote elf))
#T
> (palindrome? '(flee to me remote control))
#F
```
Do not reverse any words or sentences in your solution.

```Scheme
(define (palindrome? sent)
  (palindrome-helper (accumulate word sent)))

(define (palindrome-helper wd)
  (cond ((<= (count wd) 1) #t)
        ((not (equal? (first wd) (last wd))) #f)
        (else (palindrome-helper (bf (bl wd))))))
```
