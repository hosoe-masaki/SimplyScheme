##### 9.4  The following program doesn't work. Why not? Fix it.
```Scheme
(define (who sent)
  (every describe '(pete roger john keith)))

(define (describe person)
  (se person sent))
```
It's supposed to work like this:
```Scheme
> (who '(sells out))
(pete sells out roger sells out john sells out keith sells out)
```

describe において sent が定義されていない。

```Scheme
(define (who sent)
  (every (lambda (person) (se person sent)) '(pete roger john keith)))
```
