##### 15.3 Write a procedure substrings that takes a word as its argument. It should return a sentence containing all of the substrings of the argument. A substring is a subset whose letters come consecutively in the original word. For example, the word bat is a subset, but not a substring, of brat.

```Scheme
(define (substrings wd)
  (cond ((empty? wd) (se ""))
        ((<= (count wd) 2)
         (let ((smaller (substrings (bf wd))))
           (se smaller
               (prepend-every (first wd) smaller))))
        (else
         (let ((smaller (substrings (bf wd))))
           (se smaller
               (prepend-first (first wd) (first (bf wd)) smaller))))))

(define (substrings wd)
  (if (empty? wd)
      (se "")
      (let ((smaller (substrings (bf wd))))
        (se smaller
            (prepend-first (first wd) (first (bf wd)) smaller)))))

(define (prepend-first first-letter second-letter sent)
  (cond ((empty? sent) '())
        ((empty? (first sent)) (se (word first-letter) (prepend-first first-letter second-letter (bf sent))))
        ((equal? second-letter (first (first sent))) (se (word first-letter (first sent))
                                                         (prepend-first first-letter second-letter (bf sent))))
        (else (prepend-first first-letter second-letter (bf sent)))))
```
