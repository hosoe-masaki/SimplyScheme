##### 18.5 Write prune, a procedure that takes a tree as argument and returns a copy of the tree, but with all the leaf nodes of the original tree removed. (If the argument to prune is a one-node tree, in which the root node has no children, then prune should return #f because the result of removing the root node wouldn't be a tree.)
```Scheme
(define (prune tree)
  (if (leaf? tree)
      #f
      (make-node (datum tree) (prune-in-forest (children tree)))))

(define (prune-in-forest forest)
  (if (null? forest)
      '()
      (if (prune (car forest))
          (make-node (prune (car forest)) (prune-in-forest (cdr forest)))
          (prune-in-forest (cdr forest)))))
```

多分違うような気がする
