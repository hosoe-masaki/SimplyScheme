##### 4.10  Write a procedure to compute the tip you should leave at a restaurant. It should take the total bill as its argument and return the amount of the tip. It should tip by 15%, but it should know to round up so that the total amount of money you leave (tip plus original bill) is a whole number of dollars. (Use the ceiling procedure to round up.)

```Scheme
> (tip 19.98)
3.02

> (tip 29.23)
4.77

> (tip 7.54)
1.46
```

```Scheme
; Answer
(define (tip total-bill)
  (- (ceiling (+ total-bill (* total-bill 0.15))) total-bill))
```
