#### Real Exercises

##### 13.5 It may seem strange that there is one little person per invocation of a procedure, instead of just one little person per procedure. For certain problems, the person-per-procedure model would work fine.

Consider, for example, this invocation of pigl:
```Scheme
> (pigl 'prawn)
AWNPRAY
```
Suppose there were only one pigl specialist in the computer, named Patricia. Alonzo hires Patricia and gives her the argument prawn. She sees that it doesn't begin with a vowel, so she moves the first letter to the end, gets rawnp, and tries to pigl that. Again, it doesn't begin with a vowel, so she moves another letter to the end and gets awnpr. That does begin with a vowel, so she adds an ay, returning awnpray to Alonzo.

Nevertheless, this revised little-people model doesn't always work. Show how it fails to explain what happens in the evaluation of
```Scheme
(downup 'smile)
```
