##### 10.4  Here are some possible changes to the rules of tic-tac-toe:

Answer the following questions for each of these modifications separately: What would happen if we tried to implement the change merely by changing the quoted sentence of potential winning combinations in find-triples? Would the program successfully follow the rules as modified?

What if you could win a game by having three squares forming an L shape in a corner, such as squares 1, 2, and 4?
```Scheme
(define (find-triples position)
  (every (lambda (comb) (substitute-triple comb position))
         '(124 236 478 689)))
```

What if the diagonals didn't win?
```Scheme
(define (find-triples position)
  (every (lambda (comb) (substitute-triple comb position))
         '(123 456 789 147 258 369)))
```

What if you could win by having four squares in a corner, such as 1, 2, 4, and 5?
```Scheme
(define (find-triples position)
  (every (lambda (comb) (substitute-triple comb position))
         '(1245 2356 4578 5689)))
```
