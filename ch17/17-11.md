##### 17.11 Write before-in-list?, which takes a list and two elements of the list. It should return #t if the second argument appears in the list argument before the third argument:
```Scheme
> (before-in-list? '(back in the ussr) 'in 'ussr)
#T
> (before-in-list? '(back in the ussr) 'the 'back)
#F
```
The procedure should also return #f if either of the supposed elements doesn't appear at all.

```Scheme
(define (before-in-list? lst w1 w2)
  (> (length (member w1 lst)) (length (member w2 lst))))
```
