##### 18.4 Write count-nodes, a procedure that takes a tree as argument and returns the total number of nodes in the tree. (Earlier we counted the number of *leaf* nodes.)
```Scheme
(define (count-nodes tree)
  (if (leaf? tree)
      1
      (+ 1 (count-nodes-in-forest (children tree)))))

(define (count-nodes-in-forest forest)
  (if (null? forest)
      0
      (+ (count-nodes (car forest))
         (count-nodes-in-forest (cdr forest)))))
```
